This website uses external APIs for fetching weather information 
and it requires doing some poxy requests to get the data securely. 
For setting up the proxy server, we have used netlify functions 
which would not work on the local machine when an html file is opened 
directly, and so, the website would not work as intended.

For the working of the website, you need to set it up on netlify or 
use netlify cli's development server. For now, the website has been 
hosted at https://weather-today-mcs.netlify.app/.
